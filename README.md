# INTRODUCTION
Sports Gambling is a massive industry with an estimated market capitalization of **$250 billion** worldwide, with the Asia-Pacific(47%) being its largest market and the US being its fastest growing market with a **10% YOY growth**

# PROBLEM
### Can a naive gambler (like us!) make money ?
We explored some questions that a naive gambler would almost certainly ask - 
* What if I always bet on the underdog ? (Or the favorite?)
* What if I always bet the home team ?
* What if I always bet the team with the highest win % ?
* What if I use different bookies ?

# APPROACH
Debunking na√Øve betting and developing a predictive intuition on money lines and spread betting
